1)notebook converted to modular code using cookiecutter template 
2)versio controll applied for code 
3)code quality improved by applying functions, type hinting and logging 
4)dvc use for creating yaml file (dvc stage add -n stage_name -d dependency -p parametrs -o output)
5)dvc used for data versioning 
while creating cookiecutter template we used git init then dvc init . We make sure here that the folders tracked by dvc is ignored by git by pu
putting it in .gitignore file.
now whenever you do dvc repro whatever present in output part of everystage in dvc.yaml will be automaticall tracked by dvc u do not need to 
explicitly do dvc add something.... It is intalligient enought to understand what needs to be tracked.
6)The only thing yoou will ned to do is add remote location for dvc. It can be local or AWS s3 location.
7)for s3:
pip install aws cli
pip install dvc[s3]
aws configuration (add secret key and aws key here)
dvc add remote -d name https://s3_bucket_name
now you can do dvc push 


now whenever you want to go back to the previous version of data then first 
git checkout 
dvc fetch 
dvc checkout
